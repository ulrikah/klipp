# Klipp

Retrieval and local storage of notes and snippets to and from the copy buffer

## Ideas for this project

- Create a CLI for interacting with the application
- Add optional retention to notes so that notes automatically can be deleted after a given amount of time, e.g. for tokens or similar
- Encryption of some of the notes?
